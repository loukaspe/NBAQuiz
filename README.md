# NBAQuiz
This is my Final Udacity's Android Basics Project. It's a simple NBA Quiz in which there are 8 questions. 
The questions are in a variety of forms, as the project required, which are: Radio Group(and Button), CheckBox, EditText and a SeekBar. 
For the seekBar I copied the code from http://www.compiletimerror.com/2013/09/android-seekbar-example.html for the listener of the bar.
The code for the rounded button is copied by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9334618/rounded-button-in-android. 
Also I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/151777/saving-android-activity-state-using-save-instance-state in order to keep some 
"fields" of the screen the same when I rotate the phone. 
By the way, the app has been tested on my Samsung S6 and working. 
I think the project matches all of https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/158/view requirements. Thank You!

PS If NBA wants to buy my app in order to sell it as merchandise, I'm open to talks around the price of a million dollars.
